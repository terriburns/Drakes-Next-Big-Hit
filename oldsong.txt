Take Care

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine you’ve had yours we both know
We know they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste ah
Pushing me away so I give her space ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that say you’re done with that
On your face girl it just don’t show
When you’re ready just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

Yeah
It’s my birthday I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine you’ve had yours we both know
We know you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say
Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true

Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true

I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

HYFR Hell Yeah Fuckin Right

Gotta do what I gotta do yeah
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up girl I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room confusing me with questions
Like:

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right all right

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month
And now she’s texting me asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right all right
And we say Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah

Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right all right
And we say Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right all right

Shot for Me

I can see it in your eyes you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it Alicia Katia
I know that you gon' hear this I'm the man
Yeah I said it bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk that's me
The way you talk that's me
The way you've got your hair up did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
And the voice in your ear that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Okay look I'm honest
Girl I can't lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl I don't get you
She says I know you changed I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Back to Back

Oh man
Oh man oh man
Not again

Yeah I learned the game from William Wesley you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96 '97 whoa
Very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah and fuck you left the boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days nigga where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap I mean woah
Can't fool the city man they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all to think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wife-in niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah goin' back to back
I got the drink in me goin' back to back
Yeah I'm goin' back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell 'em that they better as friends
Not even when you sayin' "Drizzy tell 'em again"
I been puttin' on a show it was a sell out event oh
You need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it gave me every reason
The point I'm tryna make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame or what you'd do for freedom
Please check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please please do not let these niggas near me
Please think before you come for the great one
Please who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views now it's back to that nigga

Hotline Bling

You used to call me on my
You used to you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city
you started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you you you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city
you you got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home be a good girl
You was in a zone yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city

6PM In New York

Yeah oh you gotta love it
Oh you got oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder what's next for me
Longevity wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15 percent to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley Biama Julia Ericka Southern America
Part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yea boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please take at ease where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like it's just 40 Oli and me
Cuttin' all loose ends I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
Oh you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well just not in public
Blame the city I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Sweeterman

If you oblige me I'll hang it up and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing mashallah wallahi
I swear my life story's better than stories they telling about me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna ride me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks

Hold On We're Going Home

From Time

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it you've been caught up
With them bitches I don't get it you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that

'Cause I love me I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you what are you so afraid of?
Darling you you give but you cannot take love

Yeah I needed to hear that shit I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing
Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child beautiful child I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy hah?

I love me I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you what are you so afraid of?
Darling you you give but you cannot take love

Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh?

I love me I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you what are you so afraid of?
Darling you you give but you cannot take love

Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time G
Been have up di ting dem from time G.
So I don't know what's wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh
Y'all need to know yourself.

Headlines

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No don't do it aye please don't do it aye cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it aye
Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers I ain't even gotta say it

They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know

That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know they know they know

Yeah I be yelling out money over everything money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions.
You know that they ain't even got it like that.
